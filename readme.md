# Introduction

The world of anime is vast and in all honesty, a little intimidating to anyone that doesn't know where to look. Expanse is meant to be a tool to help traverse this weird medium in hopes of finding a genre or series suited to you. 

The app utilizes the Jikan (Unofficial MyAnimeList API) and provides the user a simple UI that is meant to be inviting but effective, removing information that might not be relevant to someone new to anime.
